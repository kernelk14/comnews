* ComNews
  ** Quick Start
    First, you need Deno.
    Then, do the steps below:
    #+begin_src bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/kernelk14
    $ deno compile --unstable --allow-read --allow-env --allow-run --allow-net main.js
    $ ./comnews
    #+end_src
    Then, you also need a GitHub Personal Access Token. To access this, go to [[https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta][this link]] to add a fine-grained PAT. Copy the created token and save it as `gh_personal_access.txt` in the `comnews` directory.
  ** The `.reposub` file
    *NOTE* : The `.reposub` file should be in your home directory ("/home/{YOUR USERNAME}/.reposub")
    The `.reposub` file consists of repo names that is split into spaces.
    Example:
      #+begin_src
      kernelk14/comnews SerenityOS/jakt torvalds/linux
      #+end_src
